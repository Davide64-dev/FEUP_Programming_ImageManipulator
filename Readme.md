This repository hosts a C++ program designed for file manipulation. The project's proposal can be found [here](https://moodle2223.up.pt/pluginfile.php/218459/mod_resource/content/17/index.html). The development of this program is part of the curriculum for the [Programming](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=501671) course.

## Usage

To compile and execute the code along with all its tests, use the following commands:

```sh
make test
./test
```

This will build the program and run the associated tests.
